  # Would prefer to draw tiles from an infinite lazy stream rather than computing eagerly.
  # When playing Tetris Battles we want both players to draw the same sequence of tiles to make the
  #  game fair.
  # There is an issue with this though, since Erlang uses a global random number generator,
  #  if both games are drawing tiles using the same random number generator, they will draw
  #  different tiles.
  # The ideal way to deal with this would be to have each game have its own random number generator
  #  to use to draw tiles, each started with the same random seed. This ensures that tiles can be
  #  drawn independently but still follow the same sequence.
  # As a workaround for only having a single source of randomness, a large number of tiles can be
  #  drawn up front, ensuring anyone using this list of tiles has the same sequence. It's not ideal
  #  at all but it will do for now.
